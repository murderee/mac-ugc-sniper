# Tutorial

> Install Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for your os

> Download code as zip

> If not already, put all files in a folder

> Install [EditThisCookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg?hl=en) , go onto the roblox website, and copy your `.ROBLOSECURTIY` cookie. (This is not a cookielogger, if you are still skeptical, read the code)

> Paste your cookie in `cookie.txt`

> Copy the asset id(s) of a ugc limited(s) that has not released yet

> Paste the asset id(s) in limiteds.txt

> If using multiple ids, seperate them with one line

> Run `sniper.py` with python launcher, and set it to default

# Common Issues
## Module Error
> Run `pip3 install [module]` in terminal/powershell
> To check what modules to install, read sniper.py in IDLE. All modules show as `import [module]`
## Key Error id
> Make sure your roblox cookie is valid, and has no spaces after it
## Other issues
> Post your issue in the issues tab of this repo, and if you can send the error given (please don't send your cookie) I will try my best to answer as much as I can.
